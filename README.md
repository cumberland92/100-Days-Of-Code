# 100-Days-Of-Code
I'm going to challenge myself to do an hour of coding per day for 100 days. The results will be stored here. 

I want to learn about machine learning and how to impliment it. My first project goal is to make a program that will learn from you and eventually beat you consistently at Rock paper scissors. 

After that - this might be a stretch - I want to use reinforcement learning to teach a computer how to play melee well. I think the hardest part of this will be getting the computer to be able to interact with slippi at all. I bet the machine learning will be the easy part. Wish me luck!
